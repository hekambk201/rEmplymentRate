This project is for the Probability and statistical analysis of unemployment rates in Malaysia. I conducted 3 major statistical test and 1 optional test to prove my objective.  I used two datasets, one for global unemployment rates in 2019 and another for Malaysiaâ€™s unemployment rates  from 1991 to 2019.
